# Communicable Disease Trends in Ontario

## Overview

This repository provides an analysis of communicable disease trends in Ontario, Canada, for the year 2023. The analysis focuses on three key diseases: HIV, Salmonellosis, and Influenza - sporadic. The data is sourced from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal and processed using R programming. The findings aim to support public health interventions and guide future research on disease dynamics.

## File Structure

The repository is structured as:

- `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from the City of Toronto's Open Data Portal.
- `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was used in the analysis.
- `model` contains fitted models for analyzing disease trends and predictions.
- `other` contains relevant literature, details about data processing, and additional sketches.
- `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document, reference bibliography file, and the final report.
- `scripts` contains the R scripts used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

## Statement on LLM Usage

Some of the code were developed with the help of a large language model (LLM) for discovering the way to generate certain graphs in R code, and improving citation and paper formating in qmd. file editing. You may find all talks in the other/llm/usage.txt.
